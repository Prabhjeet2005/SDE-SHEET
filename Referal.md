Hi 
I'm a Computer Science student targeting a SWE internship at Siemens Job_Id: 477249. With internship experience at Tech Mahindra where I built RESTful APIs and projects in MERN stack and ML, I believe my skills are a great fit. Would you be open to considering me for a referral?

SUBJECT: Referral for Software Engineer Internship
Hi 

I'm a Computer Science student with a strong background in full-stack MERN development and machine learning. I noticed the opening for a Software Engineer Intern at Microsoft and was hoping you might consider me for a referral Job number:
1880847.

During my internship at Tech Mahindra, I engineered a full-stack portal with Node.js, creating over 20 RESTful APIs that reduced backup creation time and automated it. I also have hands-on experience building scalable applications from scratch, such as a hotel booking app with a secure payment gateway and an ML model that predicts diabetes with 74% accuracy.

I am confident that my skills in system design and building robust applications align well with Microsoft's work. My resume is attached for your review.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Prabhjeet Singh Sandhu
